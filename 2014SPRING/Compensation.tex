I have been contracted for 110 hours (as have you all). Looking at my contract letter, I am supposed to receive \$3,346.00 for my time. By the end of the semester, due to negligence and schedule conflicts, I fully anticipate missing $5$ hours of this time. So, I have received \$3,346.00 for 105 hours of work. Using the hourly rate of $\$3,346.00/110 \approx \$30.42$, missing $5$ hours of work constitutes a loss of $~$\$152.1. If I am allowed, I will round this to \$150.00.

Thus, by the end of this term, you are both entitled an additional \$75.00 for my not having attended the tutorials.
